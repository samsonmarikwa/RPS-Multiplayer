# RPS-Multiplayer

The RPS-Multiplayer is a Rock, Paper, Scissors game that is played over the internet by two players. It uses the Google Firebase NoSQL Cloud database for persistence and updates to the two players user interfaces. In this application, Vanilla JavaScript is used for the web page updates. The players are given turns to select Rock, Paper or Scissors. The computer will then determine which player won the round and maintain the statistics of the game. The players can tease each other via chat in the game.
